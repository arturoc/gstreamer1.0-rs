Idiomatic bindings for Gstreamer on Rust.

_From version 0.8 on this crate is no autogenerated from gstreamer and hosted here instead: [https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs](https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs). If you want to keep using the old API you'll need to stick to version 0.7._

To use it you need to install GStreamer first, in linux it's usually installed with the distribution or avaliable through the package manager in other platforms from: http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/

The wrapped objects do the ref/unref of the native GObjects themselves when references are dropped.

Most of the communication with the library can be done through mpsc::Receivers to get messages, samples...

To build the examples:

```bash
cargo test
``` 

`target/examples/appsink`

- creates a pipeline that opens the default audio input and calculates the rms of the incomming sound.

`target/examples/appsrc`

- creates a pipeline using an appsrc that allows to send data into the pipeline. In this case it generates video in rust code that is visualized through a default autovideosink.

`target/examples/gst-launch gstreamer-p√¨peline`

- creates any gstreamer pipeline, to test for example: `target/examples/gst-launch videotestsrc ! autovideosink`

`target/examples/playbin mediafile`

- creates a playbin opening and playing back the path passed as argument

`target/examples/v4l2`

- linux only, opens the default camera and shows the output through the default video sink (uses autovideosink)
